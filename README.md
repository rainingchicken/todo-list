# Todo app
https://rainingchicken.github.io/todo-list/

This is a project from Per Scholas bootcamp. We are practicing DOM manipulation.

## Description
This web app is a cute pastel green themed todo list app. Some features include
- add button (or enter key) to log your todos
- delete button what deletes selected completed todo
- checkboxes
  -  line-through the checked / completed todo
- label elements to help with accesssibility
  - so user can click on the words to check the checkbox

## Feaures to add
- buttons should change when hover or active
- checkboxes be the color of the body
- border bottom of the lists for clear separation between each tasks
- mayeb but probably not smoothing animation to the parent div when todos are added instad of abrupting increased height
